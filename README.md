#Day15ofMyLeetCode Journey – Problem: Valid Palindrome

🧩 Today’s challenge helped me strengthen my two-pointer and string filtering skills.

📘 Problem Statement:
A phrase is a palindrome if:
It reads the same forwards and backwards,
Ignoring cases and non-alphanumeric characters.

🔄 Return True if the string is a valid palindrome, else False.
🧪 Examples:
📥 Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
 📤 Output: True
 🔍 Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is the cleaned-up version.
📥 Input: "race a car"
 📤 Output: False

🔧 Concepts Practiced:
✅ Two pointers (left & right)
✅ Custom alphanumeric filter
✅ ASCII-based character checks
✅ Clean handling of edge cases (like empty strings)

🔍 Takeaway:
Understanding how to manipulate and validate strings is a must-have skill for interviews and daily problem-solving.
 This was a great practice for filtering and logic flow.
Would you use regex instead of manual filtering? 🤔
